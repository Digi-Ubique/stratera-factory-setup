# Stratera Factory Setup - User Guide

## Overview

The Stratera Factory Setup Portal is a comprehensive factory management and visualization tool. It allows you to view, manage, and configure your factory hierarchy including facilities, areas, mini factories, production lines, and workstations. The portal provides both tree and graph visualizations to help you understand and manage your factory structure.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Portal

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended)
2. Navigate to the Factory Setup Portal URL provided by your administrator
3. The portal will automatically load the Factory page with your factory hierarchy

## Main Features

### Factory Hierarchy Visualization

The portal provides two ways to view your factory structure:

#### Tree View
The Tree View displays your factory hierarchy in a traditional expandable tree format. This view is ideal for:
- Understanding parent-child relationships between assets
- Navigating through the factory structure level by level
- Quickly finding specific assets in the hierarchy

To use Tree View:
1. Click on the "Tree View" tab at the top of the visualization panel
2. Click the expand/collapse arrows to show or hide child nodes
3. Click on any node to select it and view its details

#### Graph View
The Graph View displays your factory as an interactive network diagram. This view is ideal for:
- Visualizing relationships between assets
- Understanding connections and dependencies
- Getting a holistic view of your factory structure

To use Graph View:
1. Click on the "Graph View" tab at the top of the visualization panel
2. Drag nodes to rearrange the layout
3. Click on any node to select it and view its details
4. Use mouse scroll to zoom in and out

### Node Types

Your factory hierarchy consists of the following node types:

1. **Facility** - The top-level physical location (e.g., a manufacturing plant)
2. **Area** - A section within a facility (e.g., Production Area, Assembly Area)
3. **Mini Factory** - A self-contained production unit within an area
4. **Line** - A production or assembly line within a mini factory
5. **Workstation** - Individual work positions along a line

### Viewing Node Details

When you select a node in either view:
1. The details panel on the right side will display the node's information
2. You can view properties such as name, code, type, and status
3. Additional attributes specific to the node type will be shown

### Expanding and Collapsing the View

Use the expand/collapse button in the toolbar to:
- **Expand**: Give more space to the visualization panel
- **Collapse**: Show both the visualization and details panels side by side

### Refreshing Data

To refresh the factory hierarchy data:
1. Click the refresh button (circular arrow icon) in the toolbar
2. The visualization will reload with the latest data from the server
3. A notification will confirm when the data has been refreshed

## Common Tasks

### Task 1: Exploring Your Factory Structure

1. Start in Tree View for a structured overview
2. Expand the top-level Facility node
3. Continue expanding nodes to explore Areas, Mini Factories, Lines, and Workstations
4. Click on any node to view its details in the right panel

### Task 2: Understanding Asset Relationships

1. Switch to Graph View for a visual representation
2. Observe the connections between different nodes
3. Drag nodes to rearrange the layout for better visibility
4. Identify clusters of related assets

### Task 3: Finding a Specific Asset

1. Use Tree View for hierarchical navigation
2. Expand parent nodes to locate the asset
3. Click on the asset to view its details
4. Note the asset's position in the hierarchy

### Task 4: Reviewing Asset Details

1. Select the asset in either Tree or Graph View
2. Review the information in the details panel
3. Check the asset's properties and attributes
4. Note any status indicators or warnings

### Task 5: Comparing Different Views

1. Start in Tree View to understand the hierarchy
2. Switch to Graph View to see relationships visually
3. Use the expand button to maximize the visualization area
4. Toggle between views to gain different perspectives

## Navigation Tips

### Using the Tree View Effectively

1. **Expand All**: Click on parent nodes to reveal all children
2. **Focus on Branches**: Collapse unrelated branches to focus on specific areas
3. **Quick Navigation**: Use the hierarchy to quickly locate assets

### Using the Graph View Effectively

1. **Drag to Rearrange**: Move nodes to create a clearer layout
2. **Zoom Controls**: Use mouse scroll to zoom in for details or out for overview
3. **Follow Connections**: Trace lines between nodes to understand relationships

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab**: Move between interactive elements
- **Enter**: Select the focused element
- **Escape**: Close modal dialogs or deselect nodes

---

## Understanding the Interface

### Toolbar

The toolbar at the top of the visualization panel includes:
- **View Tabs**: Switch between Tree View and Graph View
- **Refresh Button**: Reload the factory hierarchy data
- **Expand/Collapse Button**: Toggle the panel layout

### Details Panel

The details panel on the right shows:
- **Node Name**: The display name of the selected asset
- **Node Type**: The category of the asset (Facility, Area, etc.)
- **Properties**: Specific attributes of the asset
- **Status**: Current operational status

### Status Indicators

Nodes may display status indicators:
- **Active**: The asset is operational
- **Inactive**: The asset is not currently in use
- **Warning**: The asset requires attention

## Troubleshooting

### Visualization Not Loading

1. Check your internet connection
2. Click the refresh button to reload data
3. Clear your browser cache and refresh the page
4. Contact your administrator if the issue persists

### Node Details Not Displaying

1. Ensure you have clicked on a node to select it
2. Check if the details panel is visible (not collapsed)
3. Try selecting a different node
4. Refresh the page if the issue continues

### Graph View Performance Issues

1. Try collapsing some branches in Tree View first
2. Reduce the number of visible nodes
3. Use a modern browser with hardware acceleration
4. Contact your administrator for large hierarchies

### Data Appears Outdated

1. Click the refresh button to reload data
2. Check the notification for confirmation
3. Contact your administrator if data is not updating

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Tree View**: Get familiar with the hierarchy structure first
2. **Use Graph View for Analysis**: Switch to Graph View when analyzing relationships
3. **Regular Refresh**: Refresh data periodically to ensure you have the latest information
4. **Document Changes**: Note any changes you observe in the factory structure
5. **Report Issues**: Contact your administrator if you notice discrepancies
